# Employee-Salary-Prediction
This project aims to build a robust salary prediction model using features like job title, education level, experience, and age â€” with smart clustering to group sparse job titles for better interpretability. It combines visualization, encoding, and feature engineering to deliver clean, explainable predictions tailored to real-world hiring data.
